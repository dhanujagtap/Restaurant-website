        <p>Desi Donne Biryani is ancient and authentic. We always go the extra mile to 
           satisfy food lovers from all corners of the world. And so, we have taken our 
           classic donne biryani and experimented with Telangana and Andhra flavours for 
           a regional touch and a few modern flavours to give it a modern and contemporary 
           twist all the while carefully retaining the authentic taste.Having said about 
           the authenticity in taste, we source our ingredients grown with love and compassion
           directly from the smallholder farmers in the far off villages creating a
           meaningful impact for all.
