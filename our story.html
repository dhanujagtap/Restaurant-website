            <p>Desi Donne Biryani believes in using fresh ingredients and 
                home grown spices that bring an aroma to awaken the taste buds and 
                the warmth that reminds one of desi food. Every morsel of rice of this
                 scrumptious biriyani has flavours seeped into it. At the first bite of the rice,
                  you will feel a wonderful kick of the green chilli at the back of your throat
                   and a slow release of the deep flavours of the meat without an overdose of spice.
                    Whoever said thereâ€™s no such thing as biryani heaven, will be proven wrong. </p>
